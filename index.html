    <p align="center"><b>Hi. My name is Darko Paff and I am 26 years old.<br /> This is my first coding test, I'm trying
            to create a simple blog.
            I started coding lessions 3 months ago with <a href="www.sololearn.com">SoloLearn</a>.<br /> It's hard but
            if you practice
            every day you can learn a lot with SoloLearn. My plan is to go through coding lessions in this order:</b>
    </p>

    <table align="center">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>HTML</b></li>
                    <li><b>CSS</b></li>
                    <li><b>JavaScript</b></li>
                </ol>
    </table>
    <!-- Tabela -->

    <p align="center"><b> My current knowledge in Web Development is displayed in the table below: </b></p>

    <p align="center"><b>In my spare time I like reading books, magazines, excercise, watch sports. <br />
            Also I'm a big video game addict. I listen to techno music and I often visit techno parties. <br />
            My favourite football club is Partizan Belgrade, whose matches I watch with my best friend Dragana
        </b></p>

    <p align="center"><b>At this point I am employed at MaxBet cassino and my coding practice is limited,
            I can practice only <br /> when I finish work that I'm getting paid for at the time. My next lession is HTML
